David,
oops...I forgot to add the URL for my website-in-process before I committed my files AND I mean to commit them one at a time so I could give a unique description of each!  Ameteur! :)  I tried to do a pull request, but then I sort of panicked.  Is that what I should do when I want to edit something I have already committed?  I realize this is the whole point of Git--to be able to have working documents that are tracked and merged and such.  Working on it... :)

The said URL: http://www.messenger-education.org/apl_archive/epo_template.html
