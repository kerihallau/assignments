Hello David!  I have embedded how I addressed the following requirements, below: 

Design Requirements

    (2pts) Create a wireframe on paper or in [Photoshop/Illustrator/Other] that clearly shows the intent of the sections of the site
        >>> I don't know how clear this will be for you/anyone else, but it is clear (and very helpful) for me to see what needs to go where and how.  See "khallau_wire-frame_csci494.pdf" for my hand-written wire frame chaos.  
          
    (1pt) Identify the purpose of website, a paragraph
        >>> The purpose of this website is ultimately to help users explore what we now know about the planet Mercury, thanks in large part to the MESSENGER spacecraft and its teams of scientists and engineers.  Through this website, we also wish to preserve the materials created to help users learn about Mercury and the MESSENGER mission.  This website will serve as the archive since after May, 2016, the mission teams will no longer be funded and therefore the website will no longer be updated or maintained.  
    (1pt) Identify target user audiences, a paragraph or list
        >>> The target audience for this website includes students, educators, and the broader community members who wish to learn more about Mercury and the MESSENGER mission.  

    (1pt) Basic site structure or site map.  
        >>> Maybe this is more of what I did, rather than the wire frame?  I think I'll have no problem reaching the 10 points either way, so feel free to count my .pdf as 1 point instead of 2!
        
    (1pt) writing content for key words and search phrases or informational purposes.
        >>>  This is pretty much all I do.  You'll find plenty throughout, alhtough only some will be complete by the time you are reviewing this.  

Technical Requirements

    (2pts) valid HTML 5 & CSS 3
        >>>  I sure hope so!!
        
    (3pts) Use Media Queries to change the style of the major layout sections.
        at least 2 different device screen sizes: Desktop, Table, Phone
        Responsive navigation. Use "Responsive Browser Testing tools" or by resizing the screen.  
            >>> This is pretty amazing!  I have a dropdown menu and for mobile (visible-xs, smaller than 767px) and for non-mobile.  Thank you bootstrap...wow!  I used the md column size, which covers the gamut for the rest of the page (at least at the 4 column width) for the rest of the page.  It scales great when re-sizing the screen and opens up in my phone just perfectly in the mobile format.  I'll have to re-check it, though, when I add in the template.   
        
    (1pt) demonstrate a 2-column or more layout on at least one section
        >>> I have a 3 column layout so far, each equal in width.  You'll see why this makes perfect sense when you take a look at what type of information I need to present (at least on this page).  
    
    (1pt) include the site navigation that is just a simple list with your best style
        >>> I think you are talking about the nav bars here, for which I have both a mobile version and a non-mobile version.  Links aren't live yet, just so you know.  Work in progress :).
    
    (1pt) Develop good practices for content presentation and SEO
        including tile, page description, alt attributes and structured data
            >>> I think I'm doing this.  I always include alt tags, using <h1> for major meaningful headings, title, etc.
